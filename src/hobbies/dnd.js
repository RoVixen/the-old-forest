        <h3>My D&D experience</h3>
        <p>
            I have a couple years of experience playing dnd, i barely played dnd as player, in my friend's group
            i were the one who proposed the idea of playing dnd, none of us had experience so i were the one who
            had to be dungeon master, i didnt like it at the beginning, i even in some moments i considered leave
            the actual hobbie, but with some time... I noticed some things.. I recognized my errors and found the
            actual fun about mastering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally learned how to make the games fun, the actual priority is make the experience to be fun,
            if someone is not having fun, im doing something wrong, or there is a problem with the player, other players
            or even me. And adapting the actual game or history to keep the joy, unfortunately the game will not be fun
            when trying to keep the logic or realism in all moment.

            I has been mastering for 2 years, i ran curse of strahd, but thats the only book campaing i ran, i ran like many
            campaings but havent finished any.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end, the last campaing i am running is a custom campaing, this time i asked for help to my friend, he is
            helping me making the story and i help preparing the encounters teasures and map, hehe, that way its like more 
            fun for us both, we compensate ourselves our lacks and virtues. At this moment the campaing has been a success,
                everyone are having fun.
